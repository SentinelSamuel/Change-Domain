### 1) To launch the tool
```
Launch the launch.ps1
Tips :
 - You can create a .lnk to the launch.ps1 to make it easier to launch
 - You can change the default application used on a double click of a .ps1 to allow users to launch a .ps1 just double-clicking on it
```

### 3) On error

On error you have to remind that : 
```
- The maximum caracters of computer name is 15
- There is a file created during the process, named old_computername.txt that will go on C:\old_computername.txt
 and will contain the old computer name, IF YOU REMOVE IT, YOU CAN RESTART THE SCRIPT
```
